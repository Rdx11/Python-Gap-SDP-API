With Gap, you can send text, photos, videos and files of any type (doc, zip, mp3, etc), as well as create groups for up to 200 people. You can write to your phone contacts and find people by their usernames. As a result, Gap is like SMS and email combined — and can take care of all your personal or business messaging needs.
